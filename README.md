## About
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront that take in orders from customers and depletes stock from our store's inventory.

Customers can select a product by id, input the amount that they would like to purchase, and complete their order! After completing an order, the database is updated, reflecting the lower product stock available after the purchase. 

## How it Works

### 1. Our Home Page displays a **Featured Artist**, click on the band name to find out more information about them!
